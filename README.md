# Examples of inheritance and composition in JavaScript

There are two prototypal inheritance examples in this repository which work in two different ways. 

The devProto and devClass print out the same output but one uses classes and the other uses prototypes.

The devComposition instead uses composition.

Composition is usually to be preferred over inheritance be it prototypal or class.
